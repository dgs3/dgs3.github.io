title: I actually enjoy working with others

I Really like working with others.  Getting feedback.  Pooling ideas.  I'm not
gonna think of the best shit all the time, why not surround myself with smart
people who can make decisions with me.

The hardest thing to realize is that I'm not gonna have the most correct or
most innovative ideas all the time.  Taking other's good ideas and
quarterbacking them to the finish line is still a super important task.
