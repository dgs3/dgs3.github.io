title: Why I enjoy non-fiction over fiction
---
Non-fiction is generally more interesting than fiction, because some of the
dramatic stories from the past are not only true, but they generally are more
unique than what's currently being written about in fiction.

Example:
    * The Italian Wars
    * Clodius
    * Emporer Claudius
    * The whole Alexander the Great
    * Henry VIII
    * Greek dark ages.  Letters sent to the Egyptian Pharoh asking for help,
      then nothing
    * Nabonidus.  He was an archeologist almost 3000 years ago.  We has also 3
      times the age of most people back then, and witnessed a battle that was
      completely halted due to a solar eclipse

Maybe Non-Fiction is more interesting because there's absolutely elements of
fiction sprinkled in.  There has been so much dramatizing of stories, that many
have probably been blown out of proportion.
