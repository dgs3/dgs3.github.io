title: Communication Increases Accountability
subtitle: Or, it's do damn hard to finish stuff, isn't it?

I've discovered that it's pretty easy to start something, but difficult to
actually quarterback it over the finish line.

I relearn this all the time.  For personal projects, I'll think of something I
want to do, buy all the parts and get all the pieces ready for assembly (i.e.
the easy parts).  But, when it comes to putting in the actual work and
finishing, frequently I'll loose patience to get distracted by something else.

And nothing is worse than an unfinished project.  Living in my one bedroom
apartment in Brooklyn, I realistically only have a finite amount of room to
store my useless junk in.  The more things I leave unfinished, the less room I
have for stuff I actually want.

I find (again, for personal stuff) that the two things that help me finish
stuff are:

1. Working in bitsized chunks, being realistic about timelines.
2. Not telling a soul about what I'm working on.

The former helps me not spend my entire weekend on a single thing that ends up
being frusting and subsequently shelved.  Giving myself a month to work on even
small projects helps keep my interest.  The latter saves any sort of
embarassment, since telling a friend you're working on something really cool
then not finishing it feeds that frustration.  It's also nice to reveal
something when it's near or totally completed.

This is all fine and great for personal stuff, but at work this whole
methodology doesn't really pan out.  Generally, projects need to be done (or at
least functioning) as quick as possible.  And if you work on stuff either
covertly or individually, you run the risk of either somebody else doing something
similar (creating double work), or not getting input from other people that
you'll probably end up affecting.

I've found a that good way to combat this is to essentially do the exact
opposite of what I do for personal stuff.  Instead of keeping stuff close to
the chest and working slow, I'll scream from the hilltops and try to let all my
coworkers know what I'm doing, why I'm doing it, and what I hope it'll
accomplish.

Not only does this increase communication and allow me to get any feedback to
help with execution, but it also gives me the impetus I need to get something
done.  When I know everybody is in the loop, I know everybody is either
expecting me or counting on me to get whatever it is done, completed.  Being
under the gun helps me deliver what I wanted to complete in the first place.
